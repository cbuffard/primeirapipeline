In this project we will be elaboratig  a CRM, an internet page where anyone can insert sales data such as seller`s name, date, product sold, product price and product cathegory. In order to create a CRM Front end we will use Streamlit tool which is a library that creates web applications. To create the web application we will connect to a PostgresSQL database specially because it is an open source tool. To connect Python(object/classes) to PostgresSQL we will use SQL Alchemy. In order to upload and validae the the data into the data base we also need to ensure they are correct in terms of type. For example, product needs to be a string, product price, a float and so on. Pydantic library (Data contract) we will be used to validade each of the fields to ensure they are correct so we save the database correctly. Mkdocs will be the tool to document the project.
